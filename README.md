# Codes_RisingTide
This repository is for open access to source codes and data in the paper "Biological adaptation under fluctuating selection", which is currently submitted to publishers and under reviewing.

1. In "codes" folder, since random number generators (dSfmt for uniform distribution random number, gen_Beta for Beta distribution random number) are included, please **DO NOT** change the relative location of these files. **PLEASE READ** the comments at the beginning of each file, containing the key parameters for each panels of the figures. The environment for simulation is clang-800.0.42.1 (compiler) in Mac OSX 10.12.3 (operating system). 

2. In "simulated data" folder, we rearrange files by the sequence of each figure. Please note that some folders (i.e. FigS3) only have R file and lack real data, because the data is in another folder (i.e. Fig2).
