# Codes_RisingTide
This repository is for open access to source codes and data in the paper "Biological adaptation under fluctuating selection", which is currently submitted to publishers and under review.

1. **PLEASE READ** the notes at the beginning of each file, containing the key parameters for simulations and notes for plotting. 

2. In "codes" folder, since random number generators (dSfmt for uniform distribution random number, gen_Beta for Beta distribution random number) are included, please **DO NOT** change the relative location of these files. The environments for simulations are (1) clang-800.0.42.1 (Mac OSX 10.12.3), and (2) gcc version 5.4.0 20160609 (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.10). 

3. In "codes" folder, files ending with "ts" are for generating time series of population dynamics, where as files with "rep" are for generating repeated simulations (e.g. Fig. 4, 5).

4. In "simulated data" folder, we upload files according to the sequence of figures.
